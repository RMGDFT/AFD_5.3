Delta test results for different finite difference operators are stored in
the following directories where the pseudopotentials are either SSSP or SG15
and the suffix refers to the type of finite differencing employed.

SFD  = standard finite differences
AFD  = fully adaptive finite differences
FAFD = fixed adaptive finite differences
